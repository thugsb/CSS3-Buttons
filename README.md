In order to create the icons, this set of CSS3 buttons uses [HTML entities][1].

### Why use entities rather than images?

*   Faster loading, because we’re talking about text here.
*   Scalable, depending on font size.
*   Styles as color and background are easy to update via CSS.

### Minimal markup

<pre>&lt;a href="" class="button"&gt;Button&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

*Simple button, with no icon.*

<pre>&lt;a href="" class="button add"&gt;Add&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

*Note the `add` class adds the plus icon.*

#### Rendering & browsers support

The icons are added using the `:before` [pseudo-element][2]. Therefore, you won’t see any icons in browsers like IE7 and below, but the buttons will look good yet.
